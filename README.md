# riders

riders is a simple addon for World of Warcraft: Classic (Season of Discovery) addon that tracks progress on the rune acquired from the Dark Riders series
Usage:

- `/riders` - Checks current character
- `/riders name` - Checks for character named "name" on the same realm as the currently logged in character
- `/riders name realm` - Checks for character named "name" on the realm named "realm". Supports realms with spaces in name, e.g. `/ghost Thrall Lava Lash` will search for a character named "Thrall" on the realm "Lava Lash"
